## Alternative Estimation Methods for H² on Entry-Mean Basis in R (via `sommer`)
There are several alternative estimation methods for (broad-sense) heritability on an entry-mean basis. Please see our paper for more information:

> P. Schmidt, J. Möhring, J. Rath and H.-P. Piepho. 2018. Estimating broad-sense heritability with unbalanced data from agricultural cultivar trials. Crop Science **forthcoming**

### General application
For each method, you will find an example code with a small dataset and its analysis. You can simply copy-paste the example code into R and run it (given all required packages are installed).
