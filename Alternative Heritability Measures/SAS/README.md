## Alternative Estimation Methods for H² on Entry-Mean Basis in SAS
There are several alternative estimation methods for (broad-sense) heritability on an entry-mean basis. Please see our paper for more information:

### Application
For each method, you will find
* a `%MACRO` and
* an example with where this `%MACRO` is applied to a simple dataset. 

You can simply copy-paste the example code into SAS and run it (given you are connected to the internet). This works, because the respective `%MACRO` is run directly from this github page via a `proc http` command at the beginning of each example.
